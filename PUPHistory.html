    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        The history of PUP may well parallel the nation's growth and development. As it met the needs of a fledgling Philippin civil service under American rule forged from anvil of Spanish colonialism, so will it serve the rising expectations of the people in 21st century...desirous now of reclaiming their rightful place in the community of independent nations. As it has withstood the test of time, so will it continue to pace contemporary Philippine history.

        <h3>Humble beginnings as a Business School</h3>
        <p>The organic act which established the Civil Government in the Philippine Islands in 1901 made provision for the establishment of the Philippine School of Commerce. However, the school was organized in 1904. </p>

                    In response to the demand for training personnel for the government service and to the felt need to provide skills essential for private business employment, the Manila Business School (MBS) was founded on October 1904 as part of a City School system under the superintendence of Gabriel Ambrose O'Reilly.
                <br><br>
                    It offered the prescribed intermediate curriculum and such vocational-technical courses as typing, bookkeeping, stenography, and telegraphy.

                <p>
                    On account of the fact that the great majority of its students came from the province, the MBS was made into an Insular (or national) school and accordingly renamed Philippine School of Commerce (PSC). At first, the intermediate curriculum was prescribed in addition to subjects such as typewriting, bookkeeping, and stenography. Afterwards a four-year secondary course in commerce was offered in addition to the courses in Bookkeeping, Stenography, Typewriting and Telegraphy.

                <br>Audits and the Philippine Senate.

                <p>
                    The PSC was placed again under the supervision of the Superintendent of City Schools for Administrative purposes only, but retained its status as an Insular school. The PSC produced its first batch of high school graduates. During this year the course in telegraphy was discontinued since the Telegraph School of the Bureau of Posts offered better facilities.

                <p>
                    The PSC offered a one-year course in Stenography for high school graduates. The course proved to be successful and popular because of its positive results. Those who took the course got easily employed as stenographers and later as office managers.

                <p>
                    To keep in step with changing conditions, the PSC started revising its courses of study. Under the leadership of Acting Principal Luis F. Reyes, it continually raised its general requisites. To enable young people employed during the daytime to acquire further training, it opened night classes (These classes would be discontinued in 1932 because of the government's retrenchment policy).

                <p>
                    From 1904, the PSC has known several homes: an old Spanish building located at the foot of a small bridge at San Rafael Street, near the Mapa High School to an old house at the corner at Dulungbayan Street (now Rizal Avenue) and Dolores Street (now Bustos Street), Santa Cruz, Manila. Two years later, it was transferred to Gunao Street, corner Arlegui in Quiapo, in the building which now housed the Manila Blue Printing. At the end of another two years, it found itself in a building in General Solano Street, San Miguel, formerly occupied by the Bureau of Audits and the Philippine Senate where it had the consolation of staying for four years. A building behind the San Miguel Church was its next destination where it stayed for about twelve years. Then back to the Gen. Solano Building. In this last place, it remained for seven years up to 1933.

                    The PSC was merged with the Philippine Normal School (PNS) and the Philippine School of Arts and Trades. During the merger, which lasted for 12 years, it operated under the supervision and administration of the PNS Superintendent. The PSC students who completed their respective courses were considered graduates of the PNS. The PSC replaced its secondary curriculum with a two-year junior college curriculum.

                <p>
                    The existence of PSC caught the attention of then President Manuel L. Quezon. In his graduation address at the Rizal Memorial Stadium on March 26, 1940, he said in part (addressing the graduates of the School of Commerce):
                    <br><br>
                    <i>"I can tell you why you are forgotten on these occasions. It is because you do not belong here... I will do my best to get the National Assembly to set aside a special appropriation for a building for the School of Commerce, so that graduates of this school will henceforth be where they can be noticed."</i>
                </p>

            <li><b>1942</b></li>
                <p>
                    Subsequently, then Congressman Manuel A. Alazarte, with then department head Luis F. Reyes, formulated a bill to this effect and was presented to Congress. Unfortunately the Pacific War broke out. The plan was not carried out.
                    <br><br>
                    During the war years, the PSC was among those institutions of learning compelled to declare a blackout on culture.
                </p>
            
            <li><b>1946</b></li>
                <p>
                    Shortly after liberation, Superintendent Luis F. Reyes resumed tasks for the re-establishment and rehabilitation of the school. The appeal was returned with more than eight thousand pesos allocation received from the national funds of the Bureau of Public Works for purposes of repairs and maintenance of public buildings.
                    <br><br>
                    The ruins of the Normal Hall building was turned into an improvised house of learning and on August 4, 1946, it was able to open formally regular classes to surprisingly eager students. The PSC offered one-year and two-year courses in retailing merchandising and a complete four-year course in distributive arts education.
                </p>
            
            <li><b>1947</b></li>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, the PNS found it necessary to use the Normal Hall building as a dormitory. PSC, in turn, resigned to its lot of again working in humble crowded rooms. This drove school authorities to seek remedies for this unbearable situation. Representations were made to the Philippine Alien Property Administrator, through Malacañang and the Department of Foreign Affairs, for the acquisition of the Lepanto site.
                    <br><br>
                    Such representations were so intensified that on July 31, 1947 the two buildings in Lepanto (now S.H. Loyola) Street in Sampaloc, Manila were turned over to the Philippine Government for the exclusive use of the PSC. The School began to move and on August 4 the official transfer was effected.
                    <br><br>
                    Luis F. Reyes was appointed PSC Superintendent.

Besides, the Sta. Mesa (A. Mabini) Campus was assigned for the use and disposition of the PCC. Also, the titles of the lots on S.H. Loyola St. were awarded to PCC through congressional legislation.

                <p>
                    The University underwent reorganization. It adopted the "cluster colleges" set-up, where each college prepared the program and supervised all the subjects required in the degree program offered in the college. It set up a University Center for Technological Research, the function of which was to conduct research and produce inventions/innovations in technology areas most needed by the communities served by PUP. For lack of sufficient rooms, laboratories, and related facilities, the University considered the completion of the 5th floor of the XYZ-Main Academic Building a top priority in its infrastructure program.
                    <br><br>
                    The PUP also established a tie-up with the University of Life in the training of trainors/project managers needed in the KKK program, as well as with the Ministry of Trade, the Ministry of Local Government and Community Development, and the NACIDA in these agencies' continuing training program to upgrade their personnel.

                    In April 1986, the PUP presidency was reassumed by Dr. Nemesio E. Prudente, who has seen university education as an equalizing instrument that would enable the children of the economically disadvantaged to climb up the ladder of society - and to counterbalance the dominating influence of the affluent few in the nation's day-to-day affairs as well as help greatly in charting its long-term destiny.

                    <p><b>Agenda 2: Embedding a Culture of Research</b></p>
                    <p>
                        Notable achievements on President de Guzman's Agenda 2 which aims to embed a culture of research in PUP are the following:<br><br>
                        PUP convened the International Research Conference in Higher Education 2013 (IRCHE 2013) last October 3-4 at the historic Manila Hotel to celebrate its nearly eleven decades of existence as a leading academic institution.<br><br>
                        IRCHE 2013 was a gathering of educators, scholars and researchers from various public and private institutions and organizations from all over the world.  Endorsed by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the National Research Council of the Philippines (NRCP), the event went with the theme “Responding to Global Challenges through Multi-Disciplinary Research”. <br><br>
                        IRCHE 2013 is an offshoot of the successful National Research Conferences organized by PUP in 2004 and 2006. This international assemblage of research enthusiasts forms part of PUP's grand vision to transform itself into an epistemic community, an institution that generates, propagates and disseminates knowledge through research. It is primarily aimed at promoting and strengthening research in public and private colleges and universities. <br><br>
                        The University also highlighted the best practices in offering and fostering a conducive environment and culture for research; build and maintain research expertise in higher education institutions for national development; explore various modalities of research partnership/linkages between producers and consumers of research skills and knowledge; and value the significance of strategies and actions for networking among researchers in promoting and sustaining higher education research as well as output utilization through IRCHE 2013. <br><br>
                        Meanwhile, taking small steps to realize the University's goal of becoming a research university, officials from the different colleges and offices of the PUP presented their papers in international conferences and conducted university and college visits in Asia, United States, and Europe from the month of May to June. <br><br>
                        On the other hand, six faculty members from the Polytechnic University of the Philippines presented five papers during the 12th Hawaii International Conference on Social Science, last May 29 - June 1, 2013, at the Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort and Spa, Honolulu Hawaii. <br><br>

                        In addition, the Asian Media Information and Communication Center (AMIC) 22nd International Conference held at Melia Purosani Hotel in Yogyakarta, Indonesia accepted four researches from PUP. More than 250 participants/ paper presentation from 24 countries  were gathered during the four-day conference from July 4-7.<br><br>
                        Officials representing the Office of the Vice President for Research, Extension, Planning and Development presented papers in the 2013 Pinoy Youth Barometer Conference.  The Conference was held last July 19, 2013 at the Bayleaf Hotel, Intramuros, Manila. Jointly sponsored by the Asian Institute of Management Policy Center and the United Nations Children's Fund in cooperation with the Philippine Economic Society, the conference tackled papers on education, employment, and migration of the Filipino youth.<br><br>
                        On the other hand, creative food entries from the Polytechnic University of the Philippines were featured in the Research Innovation Competition and Exhibit (RICE) 2013 held at the Technological Institute of the Philippines, Aurora Boulevard, Quezon City from July 31 to August 2. <br><br>
                        Innovative food entries prepared by senior students from the Department of Nutrition and Dietetics (DND) of the College of Science qualified for the National Capital Region's Student Creative Research Category of the Regional Invention Contest.<br><br>
                        RICE aims to recognize and further develop the inventions of students from public and private schools through the help of the Technology Application and Promotion Institute and the Department of Science and Technology.<br><br>
                        Meanwhile, faculty researchers of the University presented papers in the 9th International Conference on Humanities and Social Sciences held in KhonKaen University Thailand on November 14-15.

                        PUP was invited to the said forum because of COC's inclusion in Quacquarelli and Symonds top five outstanding Communication schools in the Philippines for the year.<br><br>
                        Meanwhile, a dance delegation of PUP  visited the University of Indonesia (UI) for a series of workshops on folk and contemporary dances at Gedung IX FIB UI in Jakarta, Indonesia last November 21-26.

Coloma Jr. signed last November 5  an MOU for the joint implementation of the LifeLine organ donor campaign under the auspices of the DOH-led Philippine Network for Organ Sharing (PhilNOS), a government body tasked to promote the ethical practice of deceased organ donation and transplantation.<br><br>

                        On the other hand, The Polytechnic University of the Philippines has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Movies and Televisions Review and Classification Board (MTRCB).<br><br>
                        PUP President Dr. Emanuel C. De Guzman and MTRCB Chairman Atty. Eugenio H. Villareal signed last July 31, 2013 an MOU which provides that PUP will assist MTRCB “in the development and hosting of the latter's website.”<br><br>
                        PUP is also expected to aid MTRCB in its “online permit registration system” and “in the evaluation of the existing IT infrastructure of MTRCB.”<br><br>
                        The MOU requires PUP to develop “a web-based registration system for MTRCB which will produce ePermit once reviewed and processed by MTRCB personnel, and an MTRCB-PUP mobile application.” The mobile application will “allow MTRCB deputies to report the compliance of cinemas/television shows with the classifications/permits issued by MTRCB.” It will also enable the public to “send feedback on television/movie shows.”<br><br>
                        The review and classification board will, in return, “provide PUP the necessary information for developing the web-based registration system of MTRCB and the MTRCB-PUP mobile application.”
